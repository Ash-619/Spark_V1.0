This file lists the objectives for the Design of Spark_v1.0, that are to be met for the initial prototype of the project
	 
	The HARDWARE objectives are as follows-
	
  1. To fix the initial and required working parameters like the range of Input & Output Voltage, Current and Power
	2. To have the basic idea regarding the form factor and dimensions of the final product
	3. To perform calculations (possibly on an Excel Sheet) for the component sizing of the Sepic converter
	4. To come up with a basic schematic for the initial prototype and to perform a simulation of the design on LTSpice
	5. To verify the above design on a breadboard
	 
	The FIRMWARE objectives are as follows-
	 
	1. To come up with a basic C code for STM8s103F3P6 using STVD and STVP
	2. The code should be able to generate the required PWM signals along with a stable compensation loop using a PID to maintain a stable output (CV and CC)
	3. The MCU should also be configured to have a working UART for data transmission and reception along with a way to interact with the MCU
	4. To integrate the MCU with the above hardware to verify its working
	 
	The above objectives are subject to changes in the future. After the initial prototype is tested and once the design is verified a new branch for PCB design and BOM generation will
	be made.
