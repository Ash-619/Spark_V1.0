# Spark_v1.0
This project aims to design and develop a DIY Lab Bench Power supply using a digitally controlled Sepic SMPS based on an STM8 MCU.
The project is currently in the design stage with some specific objectives to be met for the completion of Spark_v1.0.
The objectives for the design stage are present on the commit page and will be subjected to further changes in the future.

A similar project had been undertaken at the beginning of the year 2021 as my final year project for my undergraduate Electronics Engineering degree. The project had successfully achieved a majority of its objectives with bare minimum and jellybean parts.

Spark_v1.0 will be a successor of this project which will try to achieve all the objectives placed in the commit section of this project.
